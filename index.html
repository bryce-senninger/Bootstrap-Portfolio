              My post high school education began at the University of Utah in
              2013. I had most of my generals out of the way due to the
              completion of the IB program and several AP classes offered
              through my high school. This unfortunately meant I didn't have
              much time to discover my passion in college before I was quickly
              thrust into classes specific to my declared major- a BS in
              Economics. It became evident to me pretty quickly that this wasn't
              the field I wanted to be in, and I became envious of my friends
              who had selected a path in Computer Science.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've always considered myself to be a problem solver, and a person
              that enjoys strategic reasoning and implementing complex ideas to
              accomplish tasks. Programming seemed like something that I could
              find great satisfaction in learning and pursuing as a potential
              career field.
            </p>

              I began my journey into the world of coding in March of 2019. I
              started out with self teaching some syntax and various operators
              in Javascript. I found myself enjoying the challenge of learning
              new operations and wanted to find ways to apply this learning in a
              practical way. The University of Utah Coding Bootcamp seemed like
              a wonderful way to further my skills. Right out of the gates, the
              camp had us working with html and css, providing me with the
              skills to begin implementing my knowledge and actually creating.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am excited for what the future holds, and anxiously await the
              challenges that lie in store- and the skills that I will develop
              as I tackle them.
